# Gake Studio
Gake Studio is a game editor.  
You can create computer games like you do that in GameMaker Studio Extreme.  
You can program and create sprites and the game.  
I used Java as source programming language, but you must use Python.  
In Ultimate, 3D or Full edition you can use other languages.
To get license or the studio you should follow the link: https://sites.google.com/site/gakestudiosite/
